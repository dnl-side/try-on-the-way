## üè¢ Enterprise Features Deep Dive

### Department Management System
The application supports 16 distinct organizational departments, each with:
- Unique visual iconography for instant recognition
- Color-coded event categorization
- Department-specific resource allocation
- Hierarchical participant management

```typescript
// Department configuration example
const DEPARTMENT_CONFIG = {
  1: { name: 'Management', icon: 'MdOutlineTempleBuddhist', color: '#1E3A8A' },
  2: { name: 'Administration', icon: 'MdBusiness', color: '#F1FAEE' },
  3: { name: 'IT Department', icon: 'TfiMicrosoftAlt', color: '#457B9D' },
  // ... 13 more departments
};
```

### Event Management Workflow
1. **Event Creation**: Multi-step form with validation and auto-completion
2. **Resource Assignment**: Intelligent room booking and participant selection
3. **Scheduling Patterns**: Support for complex recurring event patterns
4. **Approval Process**: Department-based authorization workflow
5. **Notification System**: Participant communication and updates
